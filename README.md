# PV-Device-Weather-Monitor-1.0
Collect and send solar radiation information (mill-Watts) through the use of a solar panel, voltage/current sensor and Bluetooth module. 

Arduino Code:
- Use the serial ino code if you want to receive the power directly to the Arduino IDE.
- Use the Bluetooth ino code if you want to receive the power to any connected Bluetooth device. ex: smartphone or computer

MATLAB Code:
- Run the Matlab code on the computer to create a graph of the power in real-time. Make sure your computer is connected to the device through Bluetooth. (Password: 1234)

Troubleshooting:
- If you can not receive the data try checking two things.
  1. The wiring is correct (Especially the TX and RX pins)
  2. The baud rate is correct (Try changing the baud rate between 9600 and 38400)
